# Code_RLSS
This is the repo that holds the code that supports the finding of our RL SS project

There are three py files here
(1) utils: This file provides basic parameters and functions needed for the simulation of the model
(2) Basic_Model: This file runs the models based on the params set in utils
(3) Plot_Basic_Model: This file plots the results of the simulation done in (2)

_**Instructions:**_
First, you need to set the params in the way you want and then run Basic_Model. This file runs simulation based on preferred params set in utils
You need to have a directory called SavedData in the root to enable you to save the simulation results.
The same saved file can be used in Plot_Basic_Model to reproduce results brought in the original MS.
